# Employee-Performance-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI
Project Description:
Developed an interactive Employee Performance Analysis Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to monitor, evaluate, and compare employee performance across departments and roles. The dashboard provides a centralized view of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as productivity, performance ratings, goal achievement, attendance, and experience levels, enabling managers and HR teams to make data-driven performance management decisions.

The dashboard transforms raw employee performance data into clear visual insights, helping organizations identify top performers, skill gaps, underperforming areas, and training requirements.
